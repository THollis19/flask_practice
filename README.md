# flask_practice
Repo for storing flask tutorial practice

Based on Flask MegaTutorial found at https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

My plan is to alter the product of the tutorial so that I have a simple blog that I can post hobby content to and have a working application to try different deployments and show that I can in fact put together a super simple bootstrap website as long as it isn't expected to do too much.
